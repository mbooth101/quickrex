<h1>Customizing TAB-completion</h1>

	<p>All TAB-completions are defined in staticly read .xml-files. This means you can change most of
	the behaviour of the code-completion feature. After a restart of Eclipse, your changes will be
	immediately active.</p>
	
	<p>There are four .xml-files in the plugin-directory of QuickREx (to be found at the site of your
	Eclipse-installation under 'plugins/de.babe.eclipse.plugins.QuickREx_x.y.z' with x.y.z being the 
	version installed on your machine (this documentation applies to 1.2.0 and later, so in case your
	installed version is earlier - please check for updates if you want to use the features described
	here!):</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>jdkCompletion.xml</li>
	<li>oroAwkCompletion.xml</li>
	<li>oroPerlCompletion.xml</li>
	<li>jregexCompletion.xml</li>
	<li>jakartaRegexpCompletion.xml</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>These contain the definitions for the code-completion feature applicable to the corresponding
	regular-expression implementation (names should be obvious).</p>
	
	<p>The following is an excerpt from the file jdkCompletion.xml which serves as an example for 
	the explanation on what can be customized and how:</p>
	
	<pre>
	&lt;completions&gt;
	  &lt;proposal key="\\" value="\\" allowPlain="true" displayString="Backslash" additionalInfo="\\"&gt;
	    &lt;retrigger re=".*[^\\]\\$" completion="\"/&gt;
	    &lt;retrigger re=".*\A\\$" completion="\"/&gt;
	  &lt;/proposal&gt;
          ...
	  &lt;proposal key="?" value="?" allowPlain="false" displayString="Greedy match 0 or 1 times" additionalInfo="? - match the preceeding expression 0 or 1 times. &amp;#x000A;&amp;#x000A;Greedy: reads the whole input, tries to match &amp;#x000A;and then (repeatedly) backs off by one character &amp;#x000A;and tries again."&gt;
	    &lt;retrigger re=".*[^\\]$" completion="?"/&gt;
	    &lt;retrigger re=".*\\\\$" completion="?"/&gt;
	  &lt;/proposal&gt; 
          ...
	  &lt;proposal key="\P{Lower}" value="\P{Lower}" allowPlain="true" displayString="Not Lower-case alphabetic (US-ASCII)" additionalInfo="\P{Lower} - (US-ASCII) not lower-case alphabetic, [^a-z]"&gt;
	    &lt;wordtrigger word="\P{Lower" completion="}"/&gt;
	  &lt;/proposal&gt;
          ...	
	&lt;/completions&gt;
	</pre>

	<p>For any completion that is to be offered, there is an element <em>&lt;proposal&gt;</em> in the file. The 
	following attributes are applicable and are all mandatory:</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li><u>key:</u> a unique key for the proposal (usually the proposal itself)</li>
	<li><u>value:</u> the full value of the proposal, i.e. the value that should be inserted if the completion is choosen 
		and no part of the completion is typed yet (the "plain proposal")</li>
	<li><u>allowPlain:</u> can be 'true' or 'false' - flag to indicate whether the proposal should be offered
		if non of the triggers (see below) fires. This is 'false' e.g. for the multiplication-indicator <strong>?</strong>
		in the above example, since we do not want to offer it if the expression currently is the empty String
		or ends with an excaped backslash (the situations where the triggers match for the proposal, see below for trigger-details</li>
	<li><u>displayString:</u> The String to display for the proposal in the TAB-completion pop-up</li>
	<li><u>additionalInfo:</u> The explanation to display in the hover if the proposal is selected in the pop-up</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The proposal-element allows two kind of child-elements which define different types of triggers.
	These and their attributes are as follows:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><em>&lt;retrigger&gt;</em> a Trigger/Mask based on regular expressions. Attributes are
		<ol><li><u>re:</u> a regular expression (JDK-style) to be matched by the current contents of the regular expression field
							for the proposal to be applicable</li>
			  <li><u>completion:</u> the completion to be used if the regular expression matches</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><em>&lt;wordtrigger&gt;</em> a Trigger/Mask based on a String. Attributes are
		<ol><li><u>word:</u> a String. If this String or a non-zero leading part of it is the last part of
					the current contents of the regular expression field, the proposal is applicable</li>
			  <li><u>completion:</u> the completion to be used if the full String in 'word' is at the end
			  	of the current contents of the regular expression field. If only parts of the 'word' are at
			  	the end of the field, the remainder of the word plus the completion is inserted</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Now consider the examples in the above xml-snippet:</p>
	
	<pre>
  &lt;proposal key="\\" value="\\" allowPlain="true" displayString="Backslash" additionalInfo="\\"&gt;
    &lt;retrigger re=".*[^\\]\\$" completion="\"/&gt;
    &lt;retrigger re=".*\A\\$" completion="\"/&gt;
  &lt;/proposal&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>This defines a proposal with the <strong>value "\\"</strong>. This is the expression for matching a
	backslash in all implementations (the first \ escapes the second one). We want this proposal
	to be shown even if the input currently is empty - in fact we want it to be shown always. Thus, 
	<strong>allowPlain="true"</strong> - the proposal is offered even if none of the triggers
	matches.</p>
	
	<p>There are two kinds of trigger-expressions which would both result in only one "\" to be inserted
	(both have <strong>completion="\"</strong>) if they are matched by the current contents and the 
	proposal is selected. These are <strong>re=".*[^\\]\\$"</strong> and <strong>re=".*\A\\$"</strong>, 
	i.e. the current contents	is anything ending with one but not two backslashes or is simply one
	backslash at the beginning of the input.</p>
	
	<p>The next example is</p>
	
	<pre>
  &lt;proposal key="?" value="?" allowPlain="false" displayString="Greedy match 0 or 1 times" additionalInfo="? - match the preceeding expression 0 or 1 times. &amp;#x000A;&amp;#x000A;Greedy: reads the whole input, tries to match &amp;#x000A;and then (repeatedly) backs off by one character &amp;#x000A;and tries again."&gt;
    &lt;retrigger re=".*[^\\]$" completion="?"/&gt;
    &lt;retrigger re=".*\\\\$" completion="?"/&gt;
  &lt;/proposal&gt; 
	</pre>
	
	<p>This defines a proposal with the <strong>value "?"</strong>. This is the expression for matching 
	the previous atom 0 or 1 times. We want this proposal
	to be shown only if there is an atom at the end of the input - at least one of the triggers should
	match. Thus, here <strong>allowPlain="false"</strong>.</p>
	
	<p>The triggers are <strong>re=".*[^\\]$"</strong> matching any non-empty input not ending with
	a single "\" (which should be followed by an escaped character) and <strong>re=".*\\\\$"</strong>
	matching anything ending with (at least two) backslashes. In both cases, <strong>completion="?"</strong>
	will be inserted.</p>
	
	<p>In fact, the last example gives a hint on the complexity of regular expressions: of course, the 
	current input could end with three backslashes - thus the first would escape the second one and the
	third would be an escaping backslash again. The second <em>retrigger</em> matches this, even though
	this is not what you would really want ("\\\?" would match "\?", the "?" would not be a multiplicity-operator).</p>
	
	<p>There is a trade-off between simplicity and correctness in this case - I have decided for simplicity as
	QuickREx will tell you or show you whether the expression does what you expect it to do.</p>
	
	<p>Finally, the last example is</p>
	
	<pre>
  &lt;proposal key="\P{Lower}" value="\P{Lower}" allowPlain="true" displayString="Not Lower-case alphabetic (US-ASCII)" additionalInfo="\P{Lower} - (US-ASCII) not lower-case alphabetic, [^a-z]"&gt;
    &lt;wordtrigger word="\P{Lower" completion="}"/&gt;
  &lt;/proposal&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>This defines a proposal with the value <strong>value="\P{Lower}"</strong> - a JDK-variant expression 
	matching any character other than lower-case characters in the standard US-ASCII alphabet (a-z).
	Again, this proposal is to be shown at any time, thus <strong>allowPlain="true"</strong>.</p>
	
	<p>The trigger in this case is an example of a <strong>wordtrigger</strong>. This is because for
	this proposal we want the trigger to fire for content ending with '\', '\P', '\P{', ... Since we
	would need to construct a lot of <strong>retrigger</strong>s in this case, the wordtrigger is used.
	A wordtrigger matches if the content ends with some 0-based substring of the word-attribute. It
	adds the remainder of the word-attribute plus the contents of the 'completion'-attribute if selected.</p>

	<p>Should you find improvements to the default completion-definitions which you feel might be interesting
	to others - or should you have a collection of ready-made regular expressions you want to share - 
	please <A href="mailto:info@bastian-bergerhoff.com?subject=QuickREx Plug-In TAB-Completion">let me know</a>.
	I would be happy to TAB-completion definitions on my web-space.</p>
